# Advent Of Code 2023

Solutions in [Kotlin][kotlin], the most **fun** language on the planet!

My solutions to the ingenious Advent Of Code 2023[^aoc] by Eric Wastl.

This is my ~~sixth~~ seventh year of Advent of Code coding in a row - my body gets trained again to get up at 5:45 in the
morning for almost a month... the addiction is real! This year even more coders are saving Christmas using Kotlin -
thanks to JetBrains' support and their cool content! Thx, [Sebi][sebi]

If you are into programming, logic, maybe also a little into competition, this one is for you as well!


[^aoc]:
[Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for
twenty-five days.
You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
